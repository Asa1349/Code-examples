# Code-examples
These are code examples from my previous programming projects or training.



## Userausgabe
First project task
<br> The main program reads a large text file containing a database of users and divides the data into categories.  It then creates a table from each list. 
The run programme reads the main file, automatically launches Streamlit in the browser and displays the table.


## Galgenm√§nnchen
My own project
<br> Here I programmed the classic Hangman game. It has a display of the gallows, a replay function and scores.


## KNN and Decision Tree
Training Machine Learning
<br> The code gives a brief insight into a K-Nearest Neighbours and a Decision Tree model. The aim of the exercise was to determine the accuracy and compare the two models.


## Lineare Regression
Training Python
<br> This code contains functions to calculate a linear regression and predict data, in this example the expected number of visitors based on the outside temperature. 
 

## LoginTool
New project task
<br> The tool automatically logs in to a specified website. To protect the client's data, I have used a text document for the URL, login credentials and driver path. 
As a little extra, you could also use encryption/decryption, but for simplicity's sake I have not done this at the moment. 
The CSS selectors or XPath elements will of course need to be adapted to the website.


## Snake
My own project
<br> Our beloved mobile phone game from the good old 90s. 
Only with a bit more colour.
